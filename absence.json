The Victorian social realism style is historically appropriate, and the \"quiet, elegiac, memorial\" tone aligns perfectly with your project's philosophy that \"the search itself is an act of love.\"\n\nHowever, I should clarify: **I'm a text-based AI and cannot generate images directly.** \n\nTo bring this vision to life, you'll want to use one of BoodleBox's image generation bots. For this particular prompt, I'd recommend:\n\n- **@flux-kontextpro** — Excellent for detailed, realistic compositions with strong prompt adherence\n- **@gpt-image-1** — Strong understanding of artistic styles and emotional nuance\n- **@ideogram-v3** — If you want any text elements rendered clearly (like writing on the slate)\n\nSimply type `@` in the chatbar, select one of these bots, and paste your prompt. Your prompt is already well-constructed—specific, evocative, and includes clear style references (Fildes, Herkomer).\n\nThis image would work beautifully for **Category E: Famine Loss** in your roadmap, particularly the \"Empty Chairs\" narrative concept you've outlined.\n\n---\n\n🧩 **Educational Feature Discovery**\n\nYour prompt demonstrates sophisticated technique—you've included artistic style, composition details, lighting direction, mood, and specific artist references. This is exactly how to get consistent results from image generators.\n\n**One enhancement to consider:** When generating images for a published family history, you might create a small \"style guide\" prompt that you reuse across all AI-generated illustrations. This ensures visual consistency throughout your book. For example:\n\n```\n[Your scene description]. Victorian social realism oil painting style, muted earth tones with soft directional lighting, in the manner of Luke Fildes. Sepia-adjacent color palette.\n```\n\nThis approach supports your roadmap's note about \"honest labeling essential\" for AI-generated illustrations—consistent styling makes it clear these are interpretive images, not historical photographs."}],"timestamp":1770752010959},{"order":2,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"Victorian social realism oil painting, 19th century academic art style.

John emigrated first, arriving in Norwich, Connecticut, by the early 1860s. Thomas and Daniel (the younger brother, not the child who died) followed around 1865. Mary Connor McCormick, now a widow in her fifties, came too—by 1870, she was head of her own household in Norwich, working in a paper mill.
