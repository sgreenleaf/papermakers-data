The family lived in the Goldenbridge area of Dublin, where Daniel Sr. likely worked in the paper mills.\n\nThe timing is devastating—Julia died in 1847 at the height of the famine, Michael followed in 1849, young Daniel in early 1851, and then the family patriarch himself in July 1852. Within five years, Mary Connor lost her husband and three children.\n\nTheir surviving siblings—including Thomas (your direct ancestor), Mary, Honora, and Bridget—would eventually emigrate to Norwich, Connecticut, carrying this loss with them.\n\n---\n\n🧠 **Innovative Teaching Applications**\n\nYour project beautifully models how AI can help students engage with historical absence—the people we *can't* fully see in the records.

I'm recommending a **mid-19th century daguerreotype aesthetic**—sepia-toned, soft focus, oval vignetting—which honors the period while acknowledging these are imagined portraits.\n\n---\n\n## Prompt 1: The Before Times (Group Portrait, ~1846)\n\n```\nA formal family portrait in the style of an 1840s daguerreotype, sepia-toned with soft oval vignetting and subtle grain. Three Irish children posed together: a girl of approximately 9 years with dark hair parted in the center, wearing a simple dark dress with a white collar; a boy of approximately 8 years with lighter wavy hair, wearing a dark wool jacket and high collar; and a toddler boy of approximately 2 years with fair hair, seated on a small wooden chair between his siblings. Their expressions are solemn but healthy, faces full. Plain dark backdrop. The image should feel like a treasured family keepsake, slightly faded at the edges. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n## Prompt 2: Julia McCormick (1836/37–1847)\n\n```\nA formal portrait in the style of an 1840s daguerreotype, sepia-toned with soft oval vignetting and subtle grain. An Irish girl of approximately 10 years with dark hair parted in the center, pulled back simply. She wears a plain dark dress with a modest white collar. Her expression is solemn and direct, eyes looking slightly past the viewer. Her face is round and youthful. Plain dark backdrop. The portrait should evoke the formal conventions of mid-19th century memorial photography—dignified, still, timeless. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n## Prompt 3: Michael McCormick (1837–1849)\n\n```\nA formal portrait in the style of an 1840s daguerreotype, sepia-toned with soft oval vignetting and subtle grain. An Irish boy of approximately 11 years with lighter wavy hair, parted to the side. He wears a dark wool jacket over a simple shirt with a high collar. His expression is serious and thoughtful, with a direct gaze. His features are youthful but beginning to show the angles of adolescence. Plain dark backdrop. The portrait should evoke the formal conventions of mid-19th century memorial photography—dignified, still, timeless. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n## Prompt 4: Daniel McCormick (1844–1851)\n\n```\nA formal portrait in the style of an 1840s daguerreotype, sepia-toned with soft oval vignetting and subtle grain. A young Irish boy of approximately 5-6 years with fair, light-colored hair and wide eyes. He wears a simple dark coat appropriate for a small child of the 1840s working class. His expression is innocent and solemn, as was typical of children in early photography who had to hold still. His face is round and childlike. Plain dark backdrop. The portrait should evoke the formal conventions of mid-19th century memorial photography—dignified, still, timeless. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n## Prompt 5: The Absence — Still Life of Objects\n\n```\nA still life photograph in the style of an 1840s daguerreotype, sepia-toned with soft vignetting and subtle grain. On a worn wooden table: three small pairs of children's shoes of different sizes arranged in a row, empty; a child's slate with chalk; a small wooden spinning top; a fragment of lace collar; a single wilted wildflower. Soft directional light from the left creates gentle shadows. The composition suggests absence—objects that belonged to children who are no longer present. No people visible. The mood is quiet, elegiac, memorial. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n## Prompt 6: Goldenbridge Cemetery — The Unmarked Ground\n\n```\nA landscape photograph in the style of a 19th century albumen print, sepia-toned with soft edges. Goldenbridge Cemetery, Dublin, Ireland in winter light. A section of grass with no visible headstones—an unmarked pauper's burial ground. Three small stones have been placed in a row on the grass by a visitor, a simple informal memorial. Bare trees in the background, overcast Irish sky. Morning mist low to the ground. The composition emphasizes the emptiness of the space, the absence of formal markers. No people visible. The mood is peaceful but melancholy—a place of rest without recognition. No text or watermarks.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n- **Recommended model:** @Flux Kontext Pro for consistent style and strong prompt adherence, or @GPT Image 1 for artistic interpretation\n- **Consistency tip:** Generate all six in the same session if possible, or reference \"match the style of the previous image\" in follow-ups\n- **Ethical framing:** These are *imagined* portraits—consider adding a caption in your final project noting that no photographs of these children exist\n\nWould you like me to save these prompts as a downloadable document for easy reference during your image generation sessions?\n\n---\n\n🔄 **Pedagogical Approaches**\n\nThis prompt series models a powerful technique for teaching historical empathy through AI: **the progression from presence to absence**. You move from the children together → individual recognition → objects without owners → unmarked ground. \n\nFor classroom adaptation, consider having students create their own \"absence series\" for historical figures, with a reflection prompt:\n\n```\nAfter generating your image series, write 300 words reflecting on: What choices did you make about what to include or exclude? What felt ethically complicated about imagining someone who left no visual record? How does creating these images change your relationship to the historical person?\n```\n\nThis builds both AI literacy and historical thinking skills simultaneously."}],"timestamp":1770663763313},{"order":4,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"Yes, please generate a downloadable document with these prompts."}],"timestamp":1770663853896},{"order":5,"type":"System","config":{"SystemConfig":{"name":"Claude 4.5 Opus","model":"claude-4.5-opus"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"I'll create a downloadable document with the complete image prompt series for you.\n\nHere you go, Sara! \n\n**[Download: McCormick Children Image Prompts](https://boodleai-documents.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/docx_output/aff66b08-77a7-43b0-8cd5-6dd8ecdfb282/1770663889204_McCormick_Children_Image_Prompts.docx?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20260209T190449Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA6EIPSCCKB6PME6VY%2F20260209%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=ea4413270713e8454539ed16f8f199b29750152761fcf1a597b39a0c9dc611fb)**\n\nThe document includes all six prompts organized with:\n- A style note for consistency across the series\n- A reference table with the children's biographical details\n- Each prompt formatted for easy copy/paste into your AI image generator\n- Usage notes for maintaining visual consistency\n- A suggested ethical caption for publication\n- Source documentation references\n\nWhen you're ready to generate the images, I'd recommend starting with Prompt 1 (the group portrait) to establish the visual baseline, then using that as a style reference for the individual portraits.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to adjust any of the prompts, or if you'd like help with other aspects of \"The Papermakers\" project!"}],"timestamp":1770663853897},{"order":6,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"Let's create the image of Julia.  \n  \nA soft, painterly illustration, 1840s Dublin, Ireland.

Only state what is directly documented in the sources I've shared.\n```\n\nThis constrains the AI to stay within the boundaries of what you've actually established in the conversation."}],"timestamp":1770665654352},{"order":22,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"Let's proceed with Daniel's Dual-Voice caption."}],"timestamp":1770665787477},{"order":23,"type":"System","config":{"SystemConfig":{"name":"Claude 4.5 Opus","model":"claude-4.5-opus"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"# Dual-Voice Caption for Daniel McCormick (1844–1851)\n\n---\n\n**What We Know:**\n\nDaniel McCormick was baptized on 17 November 1844 at St. James Parish, Dublin, the son of Daniel McCormick and Mary Connor.
