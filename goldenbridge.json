That would add human presence while maintaining the \"informed imagination\" boundary you've established.\n\n---\n\n🔧 **Prompt Engineering for Educators**\n\nNotice how this prompt uses **specific, concrete details** rather than abstract emotional language. Instead of saying \"make it sad,\" the prompt achieves emotional resonance through:\n- \"No flowers. No mourners visible.\"\n- \"bare, recently turned earth\"\n- \"three siblings buried within four years\"\n\nThis technique—**showing rather than telling**—works far better with image generators than adjectives like \"melancholy\" or \"tragic.\" The AI renders the *physical details*; the viewer supplies the emotion."},{"type":"Link","title":"Daniel Jeremiah 2026 NFL mock draft 1.0: Raiders pick QB at","url":"https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2026-nfl-mock-draft-1-0"},{"type":"Link","title":"2026 NFL Draft order for Round 1; top five needs for all 32 teams ...","url":"https://www.nfl.com/news/2026-nfl-draft-order-round-1-needs-for-all-32-teams"},{"type":"Link","title":"Lance Zierlein 2026 NFL mock draft 1.0: Electric RB Jeremiyah …","url":"https://www.nfl.com/news/lance-zierlein-2026-nfl-mock-draft-1-0-electric-rb-jeremiyah-love-cracks-top-10-49ers-take-tight-end"},{"type":"Link","title":"2026 NFL Draft - NFL Football Operations","url":"https://operations.nfl.com/journey-to-the-nfl/the-nfl-draft/2026-nfl-draft/"},{"type":"Link","title":"Bucky Brooks 2026 NFL mock draft 1.0: Cowboys double up on …","url":"https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2026-nfl-mock-draft-1-0-cowboys-double-up-on-defense-rams-snag-qb-prospect"}],"timestamp":1770772898401},{"order":8,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"Victorian social realism oil painting, 19th century academic art style. A somber, historically accurate scene of Goldenbridge Cemetery, Dublin, Ireland, circa 1851.

The cemetery—opened in 1828 to serve Dublin's Catholic faithful after Catholic Emancipation—would have been familiar ground to her by then. Too familiar. She had walked this path four times in five years.\n\nThe boys would have stood beside her in the grey Irish light, looking at the stones of siblings they barely remembered or never knew. Thomas, at seventeen, had been perhaps seven when Julia died, nine when Michael followed, eleven when little Daniel was buried. The youngest Daniel, now thirteen, carried the name of two ghosts—his brother and his father.\n\nWhat passed between them, we cannot know.

Whether young Daniel felt the weight of his borrowed name.\n\nWe know only this: they left Ireland. They never returned.

And we know they never came back.\") lands with exactly the right weight\n- Moving \"What We Know\" to unmarked prose while keeping \"What We Imagine\" labeled maintains the framework without being formulaic\n\n**One Minor Suggestion:**\n\nYou might consider adding the record numbers or a brief source citation within the \"What We Know\" section (as you have them in your PDF), or adding a footnote marker. This would maintain GPS-compliant sourcing within the narrative itself, not just in the image attribution. Something like:\n\n> *Dublin Cemeteries Trust records: Julia (BGOX75189), Michael (BGOX76246), Daniel (BGOX77369), Daniel Sr. (BGOX76903).*\n\nBut this is entirely optional—the current version reads cleanly and the sourcing is documented elsewhere in your manuscript.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a downloadable Word document with this caption formatted for direct insertion into The Papermakers manuscript? I can include the final prompt text as well, so you have a complete record of how the image was generated.\n\n---\n\n⚖️ **Academic Ethics and AI**\n\nYour source attribution for the AI-generated image is exemplary. By clearly stating the image is \"an informed imagining, not a historical photograph,\" you're modeling best practices for AI transparency in genealogical publishing. This approach—acknowledging the tool, the inputs (contemporary photo + burial records), and the interpretive nature of the output—sets a standard that other family historians should follow. Consider including a brief note in your introduction about your methodology for AI-assisted illustration throughout the project."}],"timestamp":1770773931006}]}
