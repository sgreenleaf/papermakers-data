It assessed the annual rental value of all rateable property in Ireland—land and buildings—for the purpose of determining local tax liability (poor law rates).\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n**Scope and Structure**\n- Covers all 32 counties, organized by poor law union, barony, civil parish, and townland\n- Records the name of the occupier (tenant), the immediate lessor (landlord), a description of the property (house, land, offices), acreage, and rateable annual valuation\n- Does not record family relationships, ages, or occupations\n\n**Genealogical Utility**\n- Serves as a critical substitute for the destroyed 1821–1851 census records\n- Provides a snapshot of land occupancy at a specific moment (date varies by county; Dublin was valued in 1847–1854)\n- Useful for establishing a family's presence in a townland and identifying potential landlords or neighbors who may appear in related records\n\n**Limitations**\n- Lists heads of household only; does not enumerate other family members\n- Reflects occupancy, not ownership—many listed individuals were tenants\n- Valuation dates vary significantly by location; always verify the specific year for the parish in question\n- Does not capture laborers, lodgers, or those without rateable property\n\n**Companion Records**\n- The *Cancelled Land Books* and *Current Land Books* (held at the Valuation Office, Dublin) track subsequent changes in occupancy and can extend the record forward in time\n- Revision lists document alterations to holdings after the initial valuation\n\n## Access\nDigitized and indexed versions are available through Ask About Ireland (free) and commercial platforms such as Findmypast and Ancestry. The original manuscripts are held at the National Archives of Ireland and the Valuation Office.\n\n---\n\n🔄 **Pedagogical Approach**\n\nGiven your work on *The Papermakers* and the Dublin/Goldenbridge context, Griffith's Valuation could help establish the McCormick or Gilligan families' presence in specific townlands before emigration—if they held rateable property. However, since many Famine-era and post-Famine emigrants were laborers or subtenants, absence from Griffith's does not indicate absence from the community.\n\nIf you're working to place individuals in Goldenbridge or surrounding areas, a useful follow-up prompt might be:\n\n```\nI'm searching for [surname] in the Goldenbridge area of Dublin in Griffith's Valuation. The valuation year for this area was [year]. Help me interpret what presence or absence in this record might indicate about the family's economic and social standing, and suggest companion records that could fill gaps if they do not appear.\n```\n\nThis framing invites the AI to engage with evidentiary absence as an analytical feature rather than a dead end—consistent with your research philosophy."}],"timestamp":1771613359207},{"order":2,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"What do the attached files relating to Griffith's Valuation tell you about the McCormick family?"}],"timestamp":1771613889152},{"order":3,"type":"System","config":{"SystemConfig":{"name":"Claude 4.5 Opus","model":"claude-4.5-opus"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"I appreciate you sharing the Griffith's Valuation excerpt for Daniel McCormick.

Here is what the Griffith's Valuation record documents about the McCormick family:\n\n---\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Tenant** | Daniel McCormack |\n| **Landlord** | Hubert Moore |\n| **County** | Dublin |\n| **Barony** | Upper Cross |\n| **Poor Law Union** | Dublin, South |\n| **Civil Parish** | St James |\n| **Townland** | Golden Bridge, North |\n| **Place Name** | Barrack Street |\n| **Printing Date** | 1847 |\n| **Map Reference** | 1 190 |\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation\n\n**Geographic Placement**\nThe record places Daniel McCormack on Barrack Street in the townland of Golden Bridge, North—directly adjacent to the Richmond Barracks complex visible on your accompanying map. The map confirms this is an urban/semi-industrial area within the St James parish, with the \"Paper Mill\" clearly labeled to the southwest and the Goldenbridge Cemetery nearby. This situates Daniel within the precise geographic context relevant to *The Papermakers*.\n\n**Timing**\nThe 1847 printing date places this valuation at the height of the Famine. Daniel held rateable property at this moment—he was not among the landless laborers invisible to this record type.\n\n**Economic Standing**\nThe record does not include the actual valuation figures (annual rateable value for land and buildings), which would clarify whether this was a modest urban dwelling or something more substantial. The description fields (house, land, offices) and acreage are also absent from this extract. These details would sharpen the economic interpretation.\n\n**Landlord**\nHubert Moore as immediate lessor opens a potential avenue for estate records, leases, or rent rolls if Moore family papers survive.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What was the rateable valuation amount? This would indicate relative economic position.\n- Is this Daniel the same individual connected to Thomas McCormick (the papermaker who emigrated to Norwich)? The surname spelling variation (McCormack/McCormick) is consistent with period recording practices, but the relationship requires corroboration.\n- Are there other McCormack/McCormick entries in Golden Bridge North or adjacent townlands that might indicate a family cluster?\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n\n1. **Retrieve the full valuation entry** (including valuation amounts and property description) from Ask About Ireland or the original folio.\n2. **Search for additional McCormack/McCormick entries** in St James parish and surrounding townlands to identify potential kin.\n3. **Cross-reference with Cancelled Land Books** at the Valuation Office to trace occupancy changes after 1847—this could document when Daniel left or died, and whether the tenancy transferred within the family.\n\n---\n\n🧩 **Educational Feature Discovery**\n\nThe map you've attached appears to be from the Ask About Ireland / Griffith's Valuation map viewer, which allows you to toggle between historical and modern mapping layers. The numbered plots on the map correspond to the \"Map Reference\" field in valuation records (yours shows \"1 190\"). \n\nIf you haven't already, you can use the map interface to click directly on plot numbers to pull up the corresponding valuation entries—useful for systematically surveying all occupants in Golden Bridge North and identifying potential McCormick neighbors or kin clusters.

Here is the full analysis of Daniel McCormack's Griffith's Valuation entry:\n\n---\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Map Ref** | 190 |\n| **Tenant** | Daniel McCormack |\n| **Landlord** | Hubert Moore, Esq. |\n| **Description** | Garden |\n| **Acreage** | 0 acres, 3 roods, 38 perches |\n| **Rateable Value (Land)** | £4 13s 0d |\n| **Rateable Value (Buildings)** | — |\n| **Total Annual Value** | £4 13s 0d |\n| **Location** | Barrack Street, Golden Bridge North, St James Parish, Dublin |\n| **Valuation Year** | 1847 |\n\nFor context, the adjacent entry (Map Ref 191) shows **Anthony Murphy** leasing a \"House and offices\" from the same landlord, valued at £2 2s 0d for land and £2 2s 0d for buildings.\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation\n\n**Property Type: Garden Only**\nDaniel McCormack held a garden plot—not a house. The absence of any building valuation confirms he did not occupy a rateable dwelling on this specific holding. This raises an immediate question: where did Daniel live?\n\nPossible explanations:\n- He resided elsewhere (perhaps as a subtenant, lodger, or in a dwelling below the valuation threshold) and used this garden for market gardening or personal cultivation\n- He held a separate house entry elsewhere in the valuation that has not yet been located\n- The garden was an income-generating plot attached to work or trade activity nearby\n\n**Acreage**\nAt 0 acres, 3 roods, 38 perches (just under 1 acre—approximately 0.99 acres), this is a substantial garden by urban Dublin standards. The £4 13s annual valuation for land alone suggests productive ground, not a token kitchen garden.\n\n**Proximity to the Paper Mill**\nThe map confirms that Barrack Street in Golden Bridge North sits adjacent to the labeled \"Paper Mill\" and the Richmond Barracks complex. If Daniel McCormack is connected to the papermaking McCormicks you are tracing, this garden holding places him in the immediate industrial vicinity—though the record does not document his occupation.\n\n**Landlord**\nHubert Moore, Esq. appears as lessor for multiple plots in this folio (including Anthony Murphy's house and offices). Moore family estate records, if extant, could document lease terms, arrears, or tenancy changes.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- **Where did Daniel reside?** A garden-only holding suggests he lived elsewhere. A systematic search of the full Golden Bridge North folio (and adjacent townlands) for additional McCormack entries would clarify whether he held a house separately or was housed through other arrangements.\n- **What was the garden's purpose?** Market gardening? Personal subsistence? Connected to employment at the nearby paper mill or barracks?\n- **Is this Daniel the same individual connected to Thomas McCormick (the papermaker)?** The geographic proximity to the paper mill is suggestive but not probative. Corroborating records (parish registers, mill employment records if extant, or later Cancelled Land Books) would be needed to establish a relationship.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n\n1. **Search the full Golden Bridge North folio** for any additional McCormack/McCormick entries (house, land, or offices) that might represent Daniel's residence or holdings by other family members.\n2. **Check adjacent townlands** (Golden Bridge South, Kilmainham) for McCormack clusters.\n3. **Consult the Cancelled Land Books** at the Valuation Office to trace what happened to this garden plot after 1847—did Daniel retain it? Was it transferred? When does his name disappear from the record?\n4. **Cross-reference with St James parish registers** (Catholic and Church of Ireland) for McCormack baptisms, marriages, or burials that might establish family structure and confirm residence in the area.\n\n---\n\n📋 **Academic Framework**\n\nWhen a Griffith's Valuation entry shows land without buildings, it signals a gap in the residential record that requires deliberate follow-up. A useful framework for these situations:\n\n| Question | Record Type to Consult |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| Where did the person live? | Full townland folio; adjacent townlands; Tithe Applotment Books (earlier snapshot) |\n| Did they hold property later? | Cancelled Land Books, Revision Books |\n| What was their occupation? | Trade directories, parish registers (occupation sometimes noted), newspaper notices |\n| Family structure? | Parish registers, civil registration (post-1864), gravestone inscriptions |\n\nThis \"garden-only\" finding is analytically productive—it tells you something important about what the record *doesn't* capture and directs your next search."},{"type":"Link","title":"Mccormick Family History | PDF | Genealogy - Scribd","url":"https://www.scribd.com/document/140849390/mccormick-family-history"},{"type":"Link","title":"Mccormick Famil - IrelandXO","url":"https://irelandxo.com/ireland/galway/message-board/mccormick-famil"},{"type":"Link","title":"Looking for information about Bridget and James McCormick who ...","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/RoscommonIrelandGenealogy/posts/24015361061414600/"},{"type":"Link","title":"Ireland, Griffith's Valuation, 1847-1864 - Ancestry.com","url":"https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/1269/"},{"type":"Link","title":"M is for the McCORMICK family | GenieJen - WordPress.com","url":"https://jengenie.wordpress.com/2025/04/15/m-is-for-mccormick/"}],"timestamp":1771614579587},{"order":8,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"The attached are extracted from the House Books and Quarto Books of the valuation records.

He also held a substantial residential and commercial property at Map Ref 130:\n\n- A **house with two basements** (suggesting multi-story construction or cellar storage)\n- An **office**\n- A **yard**\n- Total valuation of **£5 12s 0d** for buildings alone, plus garden value of **£11 4s 0d**\n\nThis is a significantly more substantial holding than the garden-only entry suggested. The combined valuations (Entry 130 + Entry 190) indicate Daniel McCormack was a **tenant of some means**—not a laborer or marginal smallholder.\n\n**The \"Mrs Smith\" Notation**\n\nThe later worksheet shows \"Mrs Smith\" written above Daniel McCormack's name at Entry 130. This likely indicates:\n- A subsequent occupant (Mrs Smith took over the tenancy after Daniel)\n- Or a sub-tenancy arrangement\n- The Cancelled Land Books would clarify the sequence and timing\n\n**The \"Remote\" Location**\n\nThe valuator's observation—\"This situation is remote and a bad road to it\"—suggests Entry 130 was not on Barrack Street proper but in a more isolated part of Golden Bridge North. This may explain why Daniel held a separate garden plot (Entry 190) closer to the town center.\n\n**Anthony Murphy as Neighbor**\n\nAnthony Murphy's house and office (Entry 191) sat adjacent to Daniel's garden (Entry 190), both leased from Hubert Moore. The detailed dimensions show Murphy's dwelling was modest (16 × 15.6 feet, single story at 8 feet height) with a small built office. The lease rent matching the rateable value (£2 2s 0d) suggests a straightforward tenancy without significant premium.\n\n---\n\n## Revised Understanding of Daniel McCormack\n\n| Property | Description | Land Value | Building Value | Notes |\n|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|-------|\n| Entry 130 | House, offices, yard | £11 4s 0d (garden) | £5 12s 0d | Remote location; later associated with \"Mrs Smith\" |\n| Entry 190 | Garden | £4 13s 0d | — | Barrack Street; adjacent to Anthony Murphy |\n\nDaniel McCormack emerges as a **dual property holder** with:\n- A residential/commercial complex (house, basements, office, yard) in a remote part of the townland\n- A productive garden plot on Barrack Street near the town center\n\nThis profile is consistent with someone engaged in trade, market gardening, or small-scale commercial activity—not a landless laborer. The proximity of Entry 190 to the paper mill remains suggestive but unconfirmed as an occupational connection.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **What was the relationship between Daniel McCormack and \"Mrs Smith\"?** Widow? Subsequent tenant? The Cancelled Land Books would document the transition.\n\n2. **What was Daniel's occupation?** The house-with-office configuration suggests trade or business activity. Trade directories for Dublin in the 1840s–1850s might list him.\n\n3. **Is this Daniel McCormack connected to Thomas McCormick (the papermaker)?** The geographic proximity to the paper mill and the economic profile (property holder, not laborer) are consistent with a family of some standing, but the relationship requires corroboration through parish registers or other nominative records.\n\n4. **What does \"Darby Daly\" mean in the dwelling notation?** This appears to be a previous occupant's name or a local place-name for the building. It may indicate Daniel took over an existing tenancy.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n\n1. **Retrieve the Cancelled Land Books** for Map Refs 130 and 190 to trace occupancy changes—when did Daniel acquire these holdings? When did he (or Mrs Smith) depart?\n\n2. **Search Dublin trade directories** (Thom's, Pettigrew & Oulton) for Daniel McCormack in the 1840s–1860s to identify occupation.\n\n3. **Cross-reference St James parish registers** for McCormack entries to establish family structure and potential links to Thomas McCormick.\n\n4. **Investigate \"Darby Daly\"** as a previous occupant—this name may appear in earlier valuation records or the Tithe Applotment Books.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a consolidated evidence summary document for Daniel McCormack that synthesizes all the Griffith's Valuation material we've analyzed? This could serve as a working file for *The Papermakers* research.\n\n---\n\n🧠 **Innovative Teaching Application**\n\nThis analysis demonstrates a valuable research pattern for your students or colleagues: **the published Griffith's Valuation is a summary, not the complete record.** The underlying House Books and Quarto Books contain:\n\n- Physical dimensions of structures\n- Quality ratings\n- Valuator observations\n- Evidence of tenancy transitions (like the \"Mrs Smith\" notation)\n- Lease rent vs. rateable value comparisons\n\nWhen teaching Irish genealogical methods, emphasizing the distinction between the published valuation and its manuscript sources opens significant research avenues that surname-index searching alone will miss."}],"timestamp":1771615342181},{"order":10,"type":"User","config":{"UserConfig":{"email":"greenleaf@hws.edu","name":"Sara Greenleaf"}},"text":[{"type":"PlainText","content":"3.

Documentary tone.\"*\n\nWould you like me to refine any of these for a specific model, or adjust the framing to emphasize particular evidentiary elements?\n\n---\n\n🔧 **Prompt Engineering for Educators**\n\nThese prompts follow a structure useful for historical visualization:\n\n1. **Anchor in documented specifics** (dimensions, descriptions, valuator observations)\n2. **Establish temporal and geographic context** (1847, Dublin, townland name)\n3. **Constrain against invention** (\"No people\" avoids fabricating individuals; \"realistic historical illustration\" discourages fantasy aesthetics)\n4. **Specify atmosphere** (overcast, muted tones—consistent with documentary tone rather than dramatic reconstruction)\n\nThis approach treats AI-generated images as *interpretive representations* rather than documentary artifacts—a distinction worth maintaining in any published or pedagogical use."}],"timestamp":1771615604966}]}
