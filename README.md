The Papermakers: McCormick Family Data Archive
A Digital Recovery Project by Sara Greenleaf
Project Overview
This repository contains the structured research data (JSON) for The Papermakers, a genealogical project focused on the lives of Daniel and Mary McCormick and their children in 19th-century Goldenbridge, Dublin.

The primary focus of this data archive is the visual and narrative recovery of three children who died during the Great Famine: Julia (c. 1847), Michael (c. 1849), and Daniel (c. 1851).

Methodology: The AI-Human Collaboration
This project employs a bi-directional workflow between human scholarship and artificial intelligence to bridge the gaps in the historical record:

Primary Source Grounding (Claude 4.5 Opus): Historical data from St. James Parish baptism records and Goldenbridge Cemetery burials is used to establish the "What I Know" layer of each scene.

Visual Reconstruction (Nano Banana): Using the research-grounded prompts, this model generates "Memorial Representations" of the children.

Dual-Voice Narrative: The resulting images are paired with captions that transparently distinguish between documented evidence and empathetic imagination.

File Structure & Usage
Filename: 92eaead2-84dd...json

Data Format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Integration: This file is "fetched" by a custom JavaScript widget within a LibGuide exhibit to display real-time research grounding alongside visual assets.

Ethical Statement
As the records for these children are incomplete, this project does not claim to offer "portraits" in the traditional sense. Instead, these are acts of visual memory intended to honor lives that left few traces. The limitations of AI models in depicting historical hardship (the "Famine Hardness") are acknowledged as part of the project's narrative.
